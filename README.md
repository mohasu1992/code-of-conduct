# Stark - Code of Conduct

This policy is a "*living*" document, and subject to refinement and expansion in the future. Having it public on Github and as a community that is pro-transparency, you should feel free to view the changes as they are made.

The Stark community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all Stark-sponsored spaces, including our Community and any open-source projects, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the team.

Some Stark-sponsored spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

## Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavor in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Stark prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Community Manager and/or Community Moderators reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- “Reverse” -isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Communicating in a “tone” you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Reporting
If you are being harassed by a member of the Stark community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the team or Community Manager through a direct/private message via the community platform or via email at [support@getstark.co](support@getstark.co). If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. In turn, please contact someone else on the team that you feel most comfortable with. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to Stark community spaces, and the abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Stark community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside of the Stark community spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Stark community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Stark community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Stark team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Stark spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Stark community members or the general public.

## Diversity Statement
The Stark team and community are firm believers that the world is better in color, with a variety of shapes, sizes, genders, religions, opinions and more. We value disagreement but we have zero tolerance for harassment, bullying, racism, sexism or discrimination of any kind. The Stark community welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact constructively with our community. At the end of the day, we're a community of folks coming together to ideally make the world a better place. Don't be an asshole.
